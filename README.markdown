Robertclick is a jquery click handler providing alternative click callbacks
to the default javascript events, and noticeably:

 - the 'dblclick' does not trigger the click event
 - the 'longclick' is triggered after a given delay (default: 300ms)
 - the 'dragclick' is triggered after a mouse displacement (default: 10px)

requirements:
 - jquery >= 1.7
